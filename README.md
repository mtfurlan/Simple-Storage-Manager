Simple Storage Manager
========================
This was made by two people at MHacks IV. We didn't bother to commit as different people, unsure why I was the one who got their name on all the commits, I didn't set up git.

It *might* be live at http://mhacks.scuzzball.net

Anyway, this storage system was created to aid in the controlled storage of all the random different things one accumulates over time. Where did that cool switch found in the physics department trash go? Where did the wirestrippers go? With SSM, you can keep a bit closer control over where your things go.

Simple Storage Manager allows you to easily track and find object in a myriad of different locations and storage units, and makes it simple to search your collection and add new items, whether from a mobile phone or a desktop.  QR code labels generated by the app can be affixed to boxes, allowing for instant retrieval of an itemized inventory.

Accounts are easily created using your existing gmail account, allowing for easy one-click sign-in.
