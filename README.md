Simple Storage Manager
========================
This was made by two people at MHacks IV. We didn't bother to commit as different people, unsure why I was the one who got their name on all the commits, I didn't set up git.

It *might* be live at http://mhacks.scuzzball.net

Anyway, this storage system was created to aid in the controlled storage of all the random different things one accumulates over time. Where did that cool switch found in the physics department trash go? Where did the wirestrippers go? With SSM, you can keep a bit closer control over where your things go.

This helps you maintain a list of containers such as drawers, boxes, closets, etc, and lists of all the important items in or on those containers. You can print labels for the containers, with a human readable ID, a timestamp, and a QR code that will allow you to quickly pull up a list of the contents with your smartphone. You can also search for items or boxes and the built in tracking system will help you quickly locate them.

Accounts are easily created using your existing gmail account, allowing for easy one-click sign-in.
API and Android app coming soon.
